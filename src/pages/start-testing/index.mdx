# Start Testing for Web Accessibility

A light introduction to a variety of in-browser testing tools. Run some audits over a mug of coffee (or whatever). You will learn _a ton_ by learning about and addressing errors.

> Highly recommend running audits with each tool as you read, to experiment with them. A great page to run tests on is "[Accessible University](https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/AU/before.html)", a fictional university homepage intentionally designed to show accessibility errors.

## Testing Tools

### Lighthouse

[Google's Lighthouse tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) is an open-source, automated tool for measuring web pages.

#### Testing with Lighthouse

You can run Lighthouse in the browser (without installing anything), in Chrome DevTools (if you're using Chrome) or from the command line:

- Run an audit from the browser at [web.dev/measure](https://web.dev/measure).
- Learn how to [run Lighthouse in Chrome dev tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#devtools).
- Learn how to [run Lighthouse from the command line](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#cli).

> Note: There are other ways to run Lighthouse, but these options are the easiest to get started with.

#### Interpreting Lighthouse Results

The audit will return a numerical score for four categories: Performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

> Note: These scores are useful benchmarks, but can give a false impression -- a score of 100 for accessibility means that no programmatically identifiable errors were found. But we established that only 25% of WCAG conformance failures can be detected with automated testing. But! It's a great place to start!

The audit will also return a listing of flagged violations and warnings, sortable by "impact" ("high", "medium", "low"). You'll find the accessibility warnings under the "Accessibility" category.

Each flagged item links directly to a resource where you can learn how to fix the item. Going one-by-one through these items is a great way to learn.

### WAVE

The [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) is developed and made available as a free community service by [WebAIM](http://webaim.org/). With the WAVE tool, you can evaluate accessibility feedback directly in the context of the page.

#### Testing with WAVE

Like with Lighthouse, you have several options for running WAVE; The easiest options are to run it in the browser (no need to install), or to run it via a browser extension.

- Run an audit on a web page from the [WAVE homepage](https://wave.webaim.org/).
- Install a [WAVE browser extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) (Chrome and Firefox available).

#### Interpreting WAVE results

WAVE will overlay the web page with embedded icons and indicators that present in-context feedback about the accessibility of elements on the page. WAVE also presents a sidebar with a report section with tab views:[^wave-help]

- **Summary**: A summary of errors, alerts, features, structural elements and HTML5 elements and ARIA attributes detected.
- **Detail**: A listing of all the WAVE icons in your page. Clicking an item will change your focus from the sidebar directly to the element in question in the audited page.
- **Documentation**: Explanation of the WAVE icons and how you can make your page more accessible.
- **Outline**: The heading structure of the page.

#### WAVE Views

WAVE displays accessibility information in three views:[^wave-help]

- **Styles**: Presents the styled page with embedded accessibility icons and indicators.
- **No Styles**: Presents the page with styles disabled with embedded accessibility icons and indicators. This view is great for reviewing the underlying reading and navigation order of the page.
- **Contrast**: Shows only the contrast issues found on your page.

### Axe

[Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) is an accessibility testing engine for websites and other HTML-based user interfaces.[^axe-core-readme] It's an open-source product of [Deque](https://www.deque.com/), a digital accessibility company.

#### Testing with Axe

There are a variety of ways to test with the Axe library. The easiest way to test a web page in the browser is with the Axe browser extension (available for [Chrome](http://bitly.com/aXe-Chrome) and [Firefox](http://bit.ly/axe-Firefox)).

There are just a few steps to testing with the Axe extension:

1. Download the axe extension for Chrome or the axe extension for Firefox.
2. Go to the page you want to test.
3. Open up your browser’s developer tools menu. You can do this by right-clicking on the page and selecting “Inspect” or “Inspect Element.”
4. Select the axe tab in the developer tools menu.
   - In Firefox the tab is named “Accessibility” or “axe Accessibility Audit.”
5. Hit the big “Analyze” button.

#### Interpreting Axe Results

After analysis is complete, the Axe pane shows a list of accessibility issues it identified, as well as how many times the issue was found to occur on the page. Clicking an issue shows more detail, including:

- A description of the issue
- A link to additional info on how to evaluate or address the issue
- A snippet of the code that has caused the issue
- The issue's impact level

You can select "Inspect node" to inspect (in the "Elements" tab of your dev tools) the code related the issue. You can turn on "Highlight", which will visually outline the UI generated by the code related to the issue.

### Accessibility Insights

[Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) is a set of free testing tools from Microsoft. It uses axe-core under the hood. The suite of testing tools currently includes browser extensions for Chrome and Edge Insider, as well as an application for testing Windows applications. We'll continue to focus on browser testing here, and talk about [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview) (the browser extensions).

#### Testing with Accessibility Insights

Accessibility Insights for Web supports two primary workflows: FastPass and Assessment.

##### FastPass

The "FastPass" workflow is a two-step process that helps quickly identify common, high-impact accessibility issues.

1. Automated checks: It automatically scans for compliance with approximately 50 accessibility requirements.
2. Tab stops: It provides clear instructions and a visual helper to assist in identifying critical accessibility issues related to keyboard access, such as missing tab stops, keyboard traps, and incorrect tab order.

##### Assessment

The "Assessment" workflow assists in verifying that a web app or web site is compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA, through a combination of automated and manual tests (many of which are guided).

1. Automated checks: It automatically checks for compliance with approximately 50 accessibility requirements.
2. Manual tests: It provides step-by-step instructions, examples, and how-to-fix guidance for approximately 20 tests, such as keyboard, focus, semantics, pointer / motion, and more. Many tests are "assisted", which means that the tool identifies the test instances or provides a visual helper.
