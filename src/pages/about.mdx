# About

A11y Coffee is primarily intended for web developers, but may be useful for anyone interested in learning more about web accessibility.

I created it because I wanted a single, consolidated resource to send when someone asks "what is web accessibility and how do I get started?" The goal of that resource is to summarize everything I would want to communicate to that person, to answer their question.

I hope you find it useful!
