Happy (hopefully chill) Friday! End of the week and you don't want to dig into a new big ticket, but want to make an impact? DO deploy, and make it an accessibility ("a11y") fix.

## #a11yDeployFriday

Maintaining accessibility in your websites and applications takes consistent attention -- just like monitoring performance. It's not a one-and-done.

### 1. Pick a site

So many options:

1. A personal site or side project
2. An open source site you can contribute to
3. A site you contribute to at your day job

### 2. Run an audit

Run an [accessibility audit](/start-testing).

### 3. Do something

All sizes are impactful.

1. **Teeny**: Fix one issue.
2. **Small**: Fix multiple issues!
3. **Medium**: Create informative issues or tickets capturing work that needs doing based on your audit findings.
4. **Large**: After creating issues for yourself and others, start working through them!

If you make one small change, you've made the internet a better place today.
