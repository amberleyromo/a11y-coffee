# Quick wins for web accessibility

## Summary

In 2019, the [WebAIM project](https://webaim.org/) published an [accessibility evaluation of the home pages of the top 1,000,000 websites](https://webaim.org/projects/million/). The evaluation used an [automated testing tool called WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/). The report found detectable WCAG 2 failures on 97.8% of tested home pages.

> _Automated testing can only detect around 25% of possible WCAG conformance failures.[^webaim-million] The absence of detectable errors does not necessarily mean that a site is accessible or compliant._

The topic and practice of web accessibility is wide-ranging and nuanced, which can make it feel hard to get started. A good place to start is to correct the most common errors identified in the study. This page will overview those most common errors.

## Most common web accessibility errors

### Low contrast

Users must be able to _perceive_ content on the page. A sufficient contrast ratio supports that perception. Ensure that you're using sufficient color contrast.

In WCAG, contrast is measured using "relative luminance". Relative luminance is the brightness between two colors.[^webaim-contrast] Relative luminance is expressed as a ratio ranging from 1:1 (white text on a white background) to 21:1 (black text on a white background).

> _The second example shown is deliberately a contrast error. It shows white text on a white background, illustrating a contrast ratio of 1:1._

<ImageGallery>

<ColorContrast background="#fff" foreground="#000" ratio="21:1" />

<ColorContrast background="#fff" foreground="#fff" ratio="1:1" />

</ImageGallery>

WCAG defines two levels of compliance for color contrast.

#### Text

[Regular text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text) and [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-images-of-text) must satisfy a [minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum). The [enhanced minimum requirement is 7:1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-enhanced).

<ImageGallery>

<ColorContrast
  background="#ccc"
  foreground="#565656"
  ratio="4.6:1"
  fontSize="1"
/>

<ColorContrast
  background="#ccc"
  foreground="#393939"
  ratio="7.19:1"
  fontSize="1"
/>

</ImageGallery>

#### Large text

[Large-scale text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-large-scale) and images of large-scale text must meet a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. The enhanced minimum requirement is 4.5:1.

<ImageGallery>

<ColorContrast
  background="#ccc"
  foreground="#707070"
  ratio="3.08:1"
  fontSize="4"
/>

<ColorContrast
  background="#ccc"
  foreground="#565656"
  ratio="4.6:1"
  fontSize="4"
/>

</ImageGallery>

<Callout>

**Solution:** Ensure [text elements have sufficient color contrast against the background](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.3/color-contrast).

</Callout>

### Missing alt text for images

Missing alt text for images is the second most common culprit. Ensure that you provide the `alt` attribute and a descriptive text value for each web image.

```html
<img src="./feature-image" />
```

This example image element above is missing an `alt` attribute. If you can't see the image and there's no alternative text, there's no means for a user to understand the intent of the image.

```html
<img
  src="./feature-image"
  alt="Short-coated brown puppy, background blurred."
/>
```

With the alt attribute providing sufficient descriptive text, users can discern the content of the photo without having seen the image.

<Callout>

**Solution:** Ensure [images have alternative text](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.3/image-alt).

</Callout>

### Empty links

If a link contains no text, the function or purpose of the link will be imperceptible to some users. This happens when an anchor element has an `href` attribute but contains no text, or a linked image has no alternative text.

This example pulled from the Washington Post's homepage shows a common example:

```html
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/washingtonpost">
    <span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>
</a>
```

That markup displays a social icon that links out to Twitter. However, it lacks link text to communicate the purpose of the link non-visually.

<Callout>

**Solution:** Ensure [links have discernible text](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.3/link-name).

</Callout>

### Missing form input labels

Missing form input labels can make it difficult or impossible for users to submit forms.

#### Example with form input labels missing

The following form example is modified from the University of Washington's ["Accessible University" fictional homepage](https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/AU/before.html). In this example, the text "Name" is near the intended input area. That relationship will be clear to most sighted users, but not so for others. If the proper markup is not present, screen readers must guess what text, if any, describes what field.

```html
<form action="#" method="post">

    <div class="required">
        Name:
        <input type="text" name="name"/>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input
          id="submit"
          type="submit"
          name="submit"
          value="Submit" />
    </div>

</form>
```

#### Fixed example with form input labels

To explicitly associate labels with form fields, labels must be marked up with the HTML `<label>` element. The `<label>` element has a `for` attribute whose value matches the `id` attribute of the associated form field.

```html
<form action="after.html?submitted=yes" method="post">

    <div class="required">
        <label for="email">Email: (required)</label>
        <input
          id="email"
          type="email"
          name="email"
          required
        />
    </div>

    <div>
        <input
          id="submit"
          type="submit"
          name="submit"
          value="Submit"
        />
    </div>

</form>
```

<Callout>

**Solution:** Ensure [form `<input>` elements have labels](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.3/label).

</Callout>

### Missing document language

Screen reader users select a default language. If the language of a page is not specified, the screen reader will default to the user's selected default language. For multi-lingual users, this can result in strange behavior.

For example, suppose a user navigates the web in both Spanish and English, and their default language is set to Spanish. If a website doesn't define the language of the content, and the content is in English, the screen reader will read aloud English content with a default voice designed for Spanish content.

Ensure that you identify a language in the opening `<html>` element:

```html
<html lang="es">
  <!--document head and body-->
</html>
```

<Callout>

**Solution:** Ensure [`<html>` element has a `lang` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.3/html-has-lang).

</Callout>

### Empty buttons

Screen reader users won't be able to discern the purpose of a button that has no accessible name. Buttons must have discernible text that clearly describes the button's purpose, function, or action.

Screen reader users are not able to discern the purpose of button that has no accessible name.

<Callout>

**Solution:** Ensure [`<button>` elements have discernible text](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.3/button-name).
